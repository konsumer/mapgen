This will create a [tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) map from some images.

The idea is that you can take a series of maps from gameplay and output tiled maps + spritesheet for all of them. You can extract map images from gameplay video, with a tool like [animmerger](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/source/animmerger.html)

This is deployed [here](https://konsumer.js.org/mapgen).
