  <p>The purpose of this is to turn a static tilemap image (like from gameplay) into a <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a> map. Upload all your images at once, and it will create a shared spritesheet & tileset, with many maps. You can find the source <a href="https://github.com/konsumer/mapgen">here</a>.</p>
